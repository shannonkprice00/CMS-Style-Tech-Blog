# CMS-Style-Tech-Blog
## Description
This application is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. It follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
